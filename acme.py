'''
This message serves me as an example
of my first documentation
of my own code.
What is this code?. What is it doing?
This is the code for my initial part of my
sprint9 assignment for bloomtech institute.
Here i work on providing classes to represent
info for a company products.

All projects you care about should have a readme and
propper documentation and an open source LISCENCE!!!!!
SO YOUR CANT SUE YOUR COMPANY!!

Enabling others to legally use your code is necessary.
